**SETTING A FOUNDATION OF MINDFULNESS IN YOUR CLASSROOM**

Often classroom teachers tell me that they have a hard time shifting from academic instruction to mindfulness instruction during their school day. I encourage them to start early! Weaving in mindfulness from Day One helps to normalize the practice in your classroom and sets the foundation for the whole year. Read on for tips for doing this:

1\. Start with yourself. Find a time to take a few mindful minutes each day to reset your mind to presence. You might meditate after your morning shower, do some breathing exercises before your students arrive in the morning, or do some mindful stretches during lunch. Besides the benefit it provides you, having your own regular practice will enable you to share it with more confidence and authenticity.

2\. Teach through example. Use mindfulness practices to help yourself manage stress and difficult emotions during the school day. Students will notice your practice, as well as appreciate your patience and equanimity! One elementary teacher I worked with would announce to the students when she was getting stressed out and would take 10 deep breaths aloud, inviting students to do them with her. Whether the students participated or not, they noticed the effect the breathing had on their teacher. As they witnessed her get calmer, students calmed down themselves.

3\. Be yourself. You don't have to be a yogi, guru, or kung-fu master to share mindfulness with your students. You don't even have to call it mindfulness. Start by sharing simple practices that have helped you in your life.

4\. Be aware of and address the barriers that might make your students reluctant to practice mindfulness with you. Unfortunately, many mindfulness practices have been marketed only toward certain groups, have barriers to participation for many people, or are presented as religion. What kinds of people do your students think practice mindfulness? What is your social location and that of your students, and how might this encourage or inhibit motivation to practice? Explore the roots of mindfulness with your students. If appropriate, have them share practices from their own cultures that unite mind, body, and spirit.

5\. Create daily rituals. You might start each morning with a chime or a student-led mindful movement. Often teachers do just a few minutes of mindful movement and breathing during transitions, like coming in from recess or switching from group work to silent reading. Teachers have told me that taking the time for mindfulness during transitions has actually saved them time in the long run by helping students focus quicker on the task at hand. Engaging in mindfulness practices at specific times each day helps create a predictable structure, which students come to depend on and ask for as the year goes on.
