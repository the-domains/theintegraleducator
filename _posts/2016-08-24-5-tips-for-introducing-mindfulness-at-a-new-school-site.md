**5 TIPS FOR INTRODUCING MINDFULNESS AT A NEW SCHOOL SITE**

The school year is starting, and lots of my fellow mindfulness instructors are asking for advice on introducing mindfulness practice in their new school sites. Whether you are working with young children, tweens, or high school students, here are five essentials to keep in mind:

1\. Be real. Share with students why you practice mindfulness and what it does for you. A little vulnerability can go a long way in building relationships.

2\. Don't talk over students -- wait for their attention before you speak. Especially when you are first getting to know each other, students are noticing whether you can hold a safe and structured space for them. Show them that you can, so that they can relax and follow your lead.

3\. Give every student a chance to be heard. Even if it cuts down time for the practice, have each student check in, at least during the first session. They can simply say how they are feeling, or answer an icebreaker question.

4\. Learn names fast! If you go into several classrooms each day, consider drawing a seating map of each class or creating name cards which students can keep in their desks.

5\. Get students' input on what kinds of behaviors and environment would make them feel comfortable practicing mindfulness and movement with each other. You can use this input to co-create the behavior agreements for mindfulness practice together.

And finally... have fun! Every day will bring a new experience, and the more relaxed and present you are, the more responsive you will be to students' needs. And the more you will enjoy your work.
